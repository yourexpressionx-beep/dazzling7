# Security Implementation

## Security Headers

All security headers are configured in `vercel.json`:

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Restricts resource loading to trusted sources
- Prevents XSS attacks
- Blocks inline scripts (except where necessary for Vite)

### HTTP Security Headers
- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options: DENY** - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block** - Enables XSS filtering
- **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin** - Controls referrer information
- **Strict-Transport-Security** - Enforces HTTPS connections
- **Permissions-Policy** - Restricts access to browser features

## Rate Limiting

### Development Environment
Implemented via `express-rate-limit` in development:
- **Window:** 15 minutes
- **Max Requests:** 100 per IP
- Prevents spam and abuse
- Protects against brute force attacks

### Production Environment (Vercel)
Rate limiting on Vercel is handled by:
- Vercel's built-in DDoS protection
- Edge network rate limiting
- For additional protection, consider Vercel's Pro/Enterprise plans or implement API routes with rate limiting

## HTTPS/TLS

- Automatic HTTPS on Vercel
- TLS 1.2+ enforced
- HSTS preload enabled
- SSL certificates auto-managed by Vercel

## Data Protection

### Environment Variables
- Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- Never committed to repository
- `.env.example` provided for reference
- `.gitignore` configured to exclude all `.env*` files

### Session Security
- Secure session management
- HTTP-only cookies (when implemented)
- Session secret from environment variables

## Best Practices

1. **No Inline Scripts** - All JavaScript is external
2. **CORS** - Properly configured for API endpoints
3. **Input Validation** - Server-side validation for all inputs
4. **Error Handling** - Generic error messages to prevent information leakage
5. **Dependencies** - Regular updates via `npm audit`

## Spam Prevention

Currently, the site uses:
- WhatsApp links (WhatsApp's own spam protection)
- Email links (client email validation)
- Phone links (direct call, no form submission)

No contact form is implemented, which eliminates form spam risks. If a contact form is added in the future, implement:
- Google reCAPTCHA v3
- Honeypot fields
- Server-side validation
- Additional rate limiting on form endpoints

## Monitoring & Auditing

### Regular Checks
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix automatically
npm audit fix

# Update dependencies
npm update
```

### Security Headers Verification
Test headers using:
- [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com)
- [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org)

## Incident Response

1. Monitor Vercel logs for unusual activity
2. Review rate limit triggers
3. Update dependencies regularly
4. Rotate secrets if compromised

## Compliance

- ✅ HTTPS enforced
- ✅ Data encryption in transit
- ✅ Secure headers implemented
- ✅ Rate limiting active
- ✅ No sensitive data exposure
- ✅ GDPR-ready (no tracking/cookies without consent)
